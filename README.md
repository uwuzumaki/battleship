# Battleship project for The Odin Project

### Intro

This is a very rough and basic battleship game that works. I know there are definitely things I can do to improve it.
However I feel like there's diminishing returns for how much I can improve this so I'll be moving on.

### Things I could improve

- Changing directions on the ships the player can place
- Ensuring all the ships are placed by the player before the confirm button can be clicked
- A randomize button
- Prompts when the player makes an error (place all ships, Player/CPU wins, Invalid attack)
- Better colour schemes
- Classes for cubes instead of just changing the style colour
